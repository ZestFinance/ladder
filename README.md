### In ZestFinance, we do two things*:

1. Play Ping Pong
2. Give new engineers a starter project

What's a starter project? We hire not simply a list of buzzwords in a resume but on ability to learn.
As a result, developers with no experience in Ruby and Rails are hired.

These developers need to ramp up quickly.  So for a few weeks, a starter project
is assigned to new developer for the chance to ramp up quickly to the new technologies.

This was [my](https://github.com/dvillarama) starter project.

*And we do more than these two things.  Please see [Zestfinance](http://www.zestfinance.com).
